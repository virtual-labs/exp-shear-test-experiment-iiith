**Manual**

Observation:

   - Diameter of the Rod, D = ….. mm
   - Cross-section area of the Rod (in double shear) = 2x π/4x d2 =.. mm2
   - Load taken by the Specimen at the time of failure , W = N

**Procedure for the experiment is as follows.**

1. Insert the specimen in position and grip one end of the attachment in the upper portion and one end in the lower portion.
2. Switch on the main switch of universal testing machine machine.
3. The drag indicator in contact with the main indicator.
4. Select the suitable range of loads and space the corresponding weight in the pendulum and balance it if necessary with the help of small balancing weights.
5. Operate (push) buttons for driving the motor to drive the pump.
6. Gradually move the head control level in left-hand direction till the specimen shears.
7. Down the load at which the specimen shears.
8. Stop the machine and remove the specimen
Repeat the experiment with other specimens.
