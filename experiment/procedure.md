**Procedure**
1. Measure the dimensions of the test specimen.
2. Insert the specimen in position and grip one of the ends of the attachment in the upper portion and the other end in the lower portion.
3. Switch on the main switch of universal testing machine.
4. Gradually move the head control level in left-hand direction till the specimen shears.
5. Stop the machine and remove the specimen.
Repeat the experiment with other specimens.


**Virtual Procedure**
1. Start the Experiment by clicking the play button.
2. Observe the movement of top slab and pressure applied on the rod in the simulation window.
3. After a certain time, the specimen rod will break and the middle part will fall to the ground.
4. An Observation Table is provided with different trials and mean double shear strength value is calculated.
5. The Experiment allows you to pause/play/restart the simulation to view the values of different parameters at every stage of simulation.
